    <h1><strong>WHY NOT TO USE SILK?</strong></h1><br>
    <h2>BECAUSE IT HARM SILKWARM</h2> 
    <h2>BECAUSE IT IS CRUEL</h2><br>
<H3> LET SEE HOW?</H3>
<p> conventional silk is not made ethically as it requires
     boiling live silkworms while still in their cocoons, and
      child labor is not uncommon in this industry. It's also 
      not sustainable because sericulture is very energy and 
      water-intensive,and a lot of chemicals are added to the
       fabric.</p>
